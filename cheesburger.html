            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>12 ounces (340g) dried elbow macaroni (about 6 cups dry pasta)</li>
                <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef (I like 80:20)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons oregano</li>

                <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>1/4 cup tomato puree</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chicken stock</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>

                <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li></ul>
                 <h2>How To Make Recipe: </h2>
                 <p><h3>Boil the pasta:</h3>
                    Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water).<br/>
                    
                    Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, <br/>
                    stirring occasionally, about 9 to 11 minutes,<br/>
                     until mostly cooked through but still a bit firm to the bite. <br/>
                    
                    Using a colander, drain and set to the side.<br/>
                    
                    <h3>Cook the ground beef:</h3>
                    As the pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the ground beef. <br>
                    <br>
                    Season with oregano, sea salt, black pepper, chili powder, and ground cumin. Cook, <br>
                    stirring occasionally, until the beef is browned and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
                    
                    <h3>Add the butter and aromatics: </h3>
                    Add the butter, onions, garlic, and tomato puree to the skillet with the ground beef. Stir until all ingredients are combined.<br>
                    
                    <h3>Combine the pasta and ground beef:</h3>
                    Add the cooked pasta to the beef mixture and stir to combine.
                    <br> Add the heavy whipping cream, <br>
                    chicken stock, parsley, basil, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded Monterey Jack cheese,<br>
                     and 1 cup of the shredded cheddar cheese. Stir until combined.<br>
                    
                    <h3>Add to a casserole dish:</h3>
                    Transfer to a 9x13-inch casserole dish (no need to grease) and top with the remaining cheese.<br>
                    
                   <h3> Bake:</h3>
                    Bake the casserole for 15-20 minutes, until the cheese is browned and bubbly.<br>
                    
                   <h3> Serve and store:</h3>
                    For a looser casserole, serve right away.<br>
                     For a casserole that holds its shape a bit, let sit 10 minutes before serving. 
                    <br>
                    The casserole will keep, refrigerated in an airtight container, for 3-4 days.
                    <br>
                    You can also freeze it by storing it in an airtight container for up to 3 months.<br>
                     To reheat, microwave or place in the oven at 350Â°F oven until it is heated through (this will depend on the portion size you are reheating).</p>
