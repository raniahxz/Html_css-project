<h1>country</h1>

<p><section>
    A country is a distinct part of the world, such as a state, nation, 
    or other political entity. It may be a sovereign
     state or make up one part of a larger state.
     For example,
      the country of Japan is an independent,
     sovereign state, while the country of Wales is a component
      of a multi-part sovereign state, the United Kingdom. 
     A country may be a historically sovereign area (such as Korea), 
     a currently sovereign territory with a unified government
      (such as Senegal), or a non-sovereign geographic
       region associated with certain distinct political, ethnic, 
    or cultural characteristics (such as the Basque Country).</p></section>
<h2>Etymology</h2><section>
<p>The word country comes from Old French contr√©e, 
    which derives from Vulgar Latin (terra) contrata ("(land) lying opposite"; 
    "(land) spread before"), derived from contra ("against, opposite"). It most likely
 entered the English language after the Franco-Norman invasion during the 11th century</p></section>
<h2>Flags</h2><section>
<p>Originally, flags representing a country would generally be the personal flag of its rulers; 
    however, over time, the practice of using personal banners as flags of places
     was abandoned in favor of flags that had some significance to the nation, 
     often its patron saint. Early examples of these were the maritime
      republics such as Genoa which could be said to have a national
     flag as early as the 12th century
.[17] However, these were still mostly used in the context of marine identification.

<h2>Patriotism</h2>
<p>A positive emotional connection to a country a person belongs to 
    is called patriotism. Patriotism is a sense of love for, devotion to,
     and sense of attachment to one's country. 
     This attachment can be a combination of many different feelings,
      and language relating to one's homeland, including ethnic, cultural,</p>

  <h2>Economy</h2>
  <p>
    The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs annually
     produces the World Economic Situation and Prospects Report classifies 
    states as developed countries, economies in transition, or developing countries.
